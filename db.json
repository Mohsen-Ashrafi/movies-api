      "content_news1": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe dominated the past decade, bringing comic books to mainstream audiences with its star-studded cast, extravagant costumes, and sometimes underwhelming villains. However, the superhero genre has been declining in recent years, and studios have yet to fully understand why audiences are losing interest. This year, apart from 'Deadpool & Wolverine', which had a clear path to success, other superhero films struggled to find traction.",
      "content_news2": "While 'Deadpool & Wolverine' received the highest ratings among superhero films, 2024 might be the worst year for the genre since the inception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Other than the 'Deadpool' sequel, none of this year's superhero films received a 'Certified Fresh' label on Rotten Tomatoes. Even the trailer for James Gunn’s upcoming 'Superman' reboot faced significant criticism. Here’s a look at 2024’s superhero films and their reception.",
      "h1_one": "Madame Web",
      "p1": "Sony has struggled to create a standalone cinematic universe based on Spider-Man characters—without Spider-Man himself. However, 'Madame Web' might be the studio's most disastrous attempt yet. Critics panned the film as 'atrocious', despite featuring a star-studded cast, including Dakota Johnson, Emma Roberts, and Sydney Sweeney. With just $100 million at the box office, 'Madame Web' had the lowest earnings among Sony’s Spider-Man spin-offs—until 'Kraven the Hunter' came along.",
      "h1_two": "Kraven the Hunter",
      "p2": "Sony's Spider-Man universe hit rock bottom this year with 'Kraven the Hunter'. The film had the weakest domestic opening in the franchise and earned even less than 'Morbius'. While critics weren’t as harsh as they were with 'Madame Web', they still criticized its poor visual effects. Some even lamented that Sony should have spent more time on post-production rather than rushing the release after multiple delays.",
      "h1_three": "The Crow",
      "p3": "The 1994 'The Crow' is considered a cult classic, and many fans believed that its legacy—especially that of Brandon Lee—should remain untouched. Unfortunately, Lionsgate’s reboot flopped both artistically and commercially. Starring Bill Skarsgård as Eric Draven, the film received mixed reviews, with most critics calling it a weaker version of the original. Financially, 'The Crow' failed miserably, earning just $23 million against a $50 million budget.",
      "h1_four": "Joker: Folie à Deux",
      "p4": "Expectations were sky-high for 'Joker: Folie à Deux'. With Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn and the sequel to a $1 billion hit, many assumed it would be an easy success. However, the film’s shift to a musical genre and Arthur Fleck’s transformation from an anti-hero to something different led to mixed reviews from critics. The film grossed only $206 million, just over $100 million in profit. Warner Bros. insists it wasn’t a commercial failure, but it certainly didn’t match the success of the original.",
      "h1_six": "Hellboy: The Crooked Man",
      "p6": "The latest 'Hellboy' movie had little promotion, with its teaser dropping only a few months before its release on U.S. streaming platforms. While some critics called it 'boring,' others praised its horror elements. 'The Crooked Man' stars Jack Kesy as Hellboy, following a BPRD agent in 1950s Appalachia, where they encounter a small town under the influence of witches led by a demonic force.",
      "h1_seven": "Venom: The Last Dance",
      "p7": "This film concluded the 'Venom' trilogy, marking the final appearance of Tom Hardy’s Eddie Brock. 'The Last Dance' underperformed compared to previous entries, but still managed to earn $475 million, making it the eighth highest-grossing movie of the year. The story revolves around Brock and Venom facing a major decision, leading to their 'last dance.' Kelly Marcel, who wrote the first two 'Venom' films, took over directing duties this time, co-writing the script with Hardy.",
      "h1_eight": "Deadpool & Wolverine",
      "p8": "This film finally brought Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, teaming him up with Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool. While some critics called it 'messy and uninspired,' audiences didn’t care—these two characters alone were enough to make it a massive success. 'Deadpool & Wolverine' became the highest-grossing superhero film of the year, helping Disney surpass $1 billion in annual box office revenue for the first time since the pandemic.",
      "h1_nine": "Final Thoughts",
      "p9": "While 2024 had one standout superhero hit ('Deadpool & Wolverine'), the overall state of the genre is in serious decline. Poor reviews, box office flops, and audience fatigue continue to plague both Marvel and DC. With Sony’s missteps, DC’s uncertain future, and Marvel’s struggles, it’s clear that the golden age of superhero movies might be over—or at least in need of reinvention.",

We no longer have the element of surprise in the series and it has become extremely clichéd and repetitive, and it is easy to guess what will happen in the next scenes. Also, the ending of Season 2, unlike Season 1, was not at all appropriate and we did not have a proper conclusion (although it may be because the gap between Season 2 and 3 is supposedly very small). After all this gap between Season 1 and 2 and all these ads and trailers, much more was expected from the creators.",

It was very pointless that the story ended without an ending or at least close to an interesting ending. I personally liked the first season of this series, but this season was by far very poorly made..",

The use of creativity, the science of space design, and music are Nolan's signature works, which create an atmosphere that will amaze you even if the story, acting, and the film as a whole have shortcomings. Nolan has proven that music and sound are still the main and influential parts of the image.",
